# Final-Year-Project-Image-Recognition

Object Detection and Recognition using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective and useful object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. 

It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images.

It is then used to detect objects in other images.
